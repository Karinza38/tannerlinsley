Hello! I build open source software that is currently used by hundreds of thousands of developers at companies ranging from fortune 500 companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Walmart, and Target all the way down to startups and indie developers. If you or your developers use React, it's likely you are consuming one of my libraries!

Most of my open source software is written in Javascript and focused on React, Remote and Local State Management, Data Visualization, and Enterprise Application Architecture. 

### For Developers

By helping your company become a Github Sponsor, you will not only feel great about giving back to the open source tools that run your business, but you will also have some awesome perks and possible (upon agreement) have a stake in the sponsorship deal flow! Each of the sponsorship tiers on this page have their perks listed on them. If you believe your company could become a sponsor, then please reach out!

### For Companies and Businesses

By becoming a Github Sponsor, your company and brand will be recognized as a one that gives back to the open source tools that run your business and one that respects your developers time and your customers' experience. As secondary benefits, you may also be awarded some special perks based on your sponsorship tier.

### Perks

Perks depend on sponsorship tier and pre-established agreements and may include things like:
- Premium Advertising on all of my web properties
- Personal On-Demand Support
- Consultation Retainers
- Bug Response SLA Agreements

Wondering what you'll get out of having your name, brand, or logo on my projects? These stats may come in handy:

- 90,000+ Unique Monthly Visitors
- Over 2 million monthly downloads on NPM
- Over 18k personal stars on Github (50k+ external star contributions)

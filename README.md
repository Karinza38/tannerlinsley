Hello There!

I build open source software that is used by hundreds of thousands of developers, startups and fortune 500 companies, and hopefully you and/or your company, too!

Most of my open source software is written in Javascript and focused on React, State Management, Data Visualization, Enterprise Application Challenges, and is solving difficult problems for tens of thousands of devs all over the world each day. 

By becoming (or asking your company to become) one of my Github Sponsors, you will not only feel great about giving back to the open source tools that run your business, but you also get special perks! Each of the sponsorship tiers on this page have their perks listed on them.

If you or your employer are curious about what you may get out of having your name, brand, or logo on my projects, then these stats may come in handy:

At a glance, my open source properties on Github drive:
- Over 2 million monthly downloads on NPM
- Over 18k personal stars on Github (50k+ external star contributions)
- ~65,000 Unique Monthly Visitors to README pages

Beyond visibility, each tier also comes with an implicit prioritization of issues, features, and or support for your daily endeavors or challenges. Sweet right?!

If you have any further questions, feel free to send me a tweet or DM [@tannerlinsley](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley) on Twitter. Thanks!
